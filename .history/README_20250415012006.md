# PowerApps_Calendar
This repository serves as a documentation and explanation resource for a custom-built Calendar App developed using Microsoft PowerApps. The purpose of this project is to outline the design principles, architecture, and functionalities implemented in the calendar solution, rather than distributing the actual app.
