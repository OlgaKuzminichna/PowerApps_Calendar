# Calendar App for Office Days Scheduling

The Office Days Scheduler helps employees specify which days they will be working in the office and notifies others of their schedule. Users can enter their in-office days, view when others will be in, and update their office attendance status. This helps improve office management and communication, particularly in hybrid work environments.
