# Calendar App for Office Days Scheduling

The Office Days Scheduler helps employees specify which days they will be working in the office and notifies others of their schedule. Users can enter their in-office days, view when others will be in, and update their office attendance status. This helps improve office management and communication, particularly in hybrid work environments.


The application features a user-friendly interface with the following key components:

### 1. **Create Event**

- **Country Selector**: Select the relevant country for your office location from a drop-down menu
- **Office Selector**: Choose the specific office location where you'll be present from a drop-down menu
- **Seat ID**: Enter your designated seat or desk ID within the office
- **Date Picker**: Pick the date for your office attendance
- After filling in the details, click the **Create Event** button. This will trigger a Power Automate flow, which saves the event information to both an Office Outlook shared calendar and a SharePoint list. Additionally, a notification will be sent to your team via a Teams channel to inform them of your office schedule

### 2. **View Event**
- **Refresh View**: Refresh the calendar and event list to see the most up-to-date information
- Click on the day in the calendar and see below who are coming to the office 
Each event entry includes:
    - The name of the person attending the office
    - The country, office location, and seat ID associated with the event
    - A trash icon for removing your own event from the calendar
    - An edit icon to modify event details
    - You can also click on the office location to view its address directly on Google Maps


### System Requirements
- The app requires an active Microsoft account for usage, with PowerApps access permissions.
- No additional installation is required, as the app runs directly in the browser or the PowerApps mobile app.
